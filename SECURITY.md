## 🔍 Audit History

| Date | Auditor | Report | Issues Found | Status |
|------|---------|--------|--------------|--------|
| TBD | Consensys Diligence | [Link] | TBD | Scheduled |
| TBD | Trail of Bits | [Link] | TBD | Scheduled |
| TBD | OpenZeppelin | [Link] | TBD | Scheduled |

## ⚠️ Known Issues

The following issues are known and accepted risks:

1. **Front-running on AMM** - Mitigated by slippage protection
2. **Governance attacks** - Mitigated by timelock and quorum requirements
3. **Oracle manipulation** - Mitigated by multiple price feeds
4. **Flash loan attacks** - Mitigated by liquidity requirements

## 🚑 Emergency Procedures

### Level 1: Suspicious Activity
1. Automated monitoring triggers alert
2. On-call engineer investigates
3. If confirmed, escalate to Level 2

### Level 2: Confirmed Threat
1. Emergency team assembled
2. Assess impact and attack vector
3. If funds at risk, escalate to Level 3

### Level 3: Active Attack
1. **EXECUTE EMERGENCY PAUSE**
2. All contracts frozen
3. Identify and patch vulnerability
4. Prepare fix deployment
5. Community notification
6. Resume operations after fix

## 🏗️ Architecture Security

### Contract Upgradeability
- We use **immutable contracts** for core logic
- Upgradeable components use **transparent proxy pattern**
- All upgrades require **timelock + multisig**
- Community can **veto** upgrades via governance

### Dependencies
- OpenZeppelin Contracts v5.0.0 (Audited)
