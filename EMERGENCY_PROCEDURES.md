# ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES

## Critical Incident Response

### 1. CONTRACT COMPROMISE
**Indicators:**
- Unauthorized transfers
- Unexpected contract behavior
- Suspicious multi-sig transactions

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
```bash
# 1. PAUSE ALL CONTRACTS (requires 2-of-3 multi-sig)
npx hardhat run scripts/emergency-pause.js --network mainnet

# 2. Verify pause status
npx hardhat run scripts/verify-deployment.js --network mainnet

# 3. Alert team
# Send message to all signers immediately
```

**Recovery Steps:**
1. Analyze the attack vector
2. Deploy patched contracts
3. Migrate user balances via snapshot
4. Resume operations after 48-hour timelock

---

### 2. PRIVATE KEY COMPROMISE
**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
```bash
# 1. If deployer key compromised:
#    - Cannot pause (needs multi-sig)
#    - Monitor for malicious transactions

# 2. If one multi-sig signer compromised:
#    - Other 2 signers must act immediately
#    - Remove compromised signer
npx hardhat run scripts/remove-signer.js --network mainnet

# 3. If 2+ signers compromised:
#    - EMERGENCY: Pause all contracts
#    - Deploy emergency migration contract
```

## Emergency Timelock Override

In extreme circumstances (imminent fund loss), emergency 24-hour timelock can be used:

```javascript
// Requires all 3 signers
await multiSig.declareEmergency();

// Then execute with 24-hour delay instead of 48
await multiSig.executeTransaction(txId);
```
