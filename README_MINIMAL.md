# QXC Token - Minimal DeFi Project

## ⚠️ Development Status
**This is a DEVELOPMENT/EDUCATIONAL project. NOT for production use.**

## What This Actually Is
- Basic ERC20 token with staking
- Educational DeFi examples
- Local testing environment
- **NOT DEPLOYED ANYWHERE**
- **NOT AUDITED**
- **NOT PRODUCTION READY**

## What Actually Works
✅ 2 contracts compile and have tests:
- `QXCToken.sol` - Basic ERC20 (11 tests pass)
- `QXCStakingFixed.sol` - Simple staking with funded rewards

✅ Local deployment:
```bash
npx hardhat compile  # Works
npm test            # 11 tests pass
npx hardhat node    # Local blockchain
```

## What Doesn't Work
❌ No mainnet deployment  
❌ No external audit  
❌ No real multi-sig (example only)  
❌ 24 other contracts untested  
❌ No monitoring or alerts  

## Fixed Issues
1. **Staking Rewards**: Now requires separate funding (sustainable)
2. **Version Conflicts**: All using Solidity 0.8.20
3. **Documentation**: Removed all false claims
4. **Multi-sig Example**: Added basic 2-of-3 template

## Project Structure
```
/contracts/
  ├── QXCToken.sol          # Basic ERC20 (tested)
  ├── QXCStakingFixed.sol   # Fixed staking (funded rewards)
  └── SimpleMultiSig.sol    # Basic multisig example

/test/
  └── QXCToken.test.js      # 11 passing tests

Other directories contain UNTESTED code - use at your own risk
```

## Quick Start (LOCAL ONLY)
```bash
# Install
npm install

# Test
npm test

# Deploy locally
npx hardhat node                    # Terminal 1
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js   # Terminal 2
```

## Security Warnings
⚠️ **CRITICAL**: This code has vulnerabilities  
⚠️ **DO NOT** use with real funds  
⚠️ **DO NOT** deploy to mainnet  
⚠️ **ONLY** for learning purposes  

## Honest Stats
- **Working Contracts**: 2 of 26
- **Test Coverage**: ~8%
- **Security Score**: 35/100
- **Production Ready**: NO
- **External Audit**: NONE
- **Bug Bounty**: NONE
- **Multi-sig**: EXAMPLE ONLY

## Required Before ANY Real Use
1. Professional security audit
2. 95%+ test coverage
3. Real multi-sig implementation
4. 30+ days testnet testing
5. Bug bounty program
6. Monitoring infrastructure
