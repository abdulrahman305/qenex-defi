# Emergency Procedures Validation

## Overview
Validating the documented emergency response procedures against contract capabilities.

## Procedure Validation

### 1. CONTRACT COMPROMISE Response

#### Documented Actions:
- Pause all contracts via multi-sig
- Verify pause status
- Alert team

#### ✓ VALIDATED: Pause Capability
```solidity
// QXCTokenProduction.sol
function pause() external onlyRole(PAUSER_ROLE) { _pause(); }

// QXCStakingFixed.sol  
function pause() external onlyOwner { _pause(); }
```
**Verdict**: Can pause token and staking

#### ⚠ ISSUE: Missing Script
- `scripts/emergency-pause.js` not found
- **Risk**: Cannot execute documented procedure
- **Severity**: HIGH

### 2. PRIVATE KEY COMPROMISE Response

#### ✓ VALIDATED: Multi-sig Protection
- If 1 signer compromised: 2 others can act
- 2-of-3 threshold protects against single key loss

#### ❌ ISSUE: Cannot Remove Signers
```solidity
// TimelockMultiSig.sol - No removeSignor function exists
```
- **Finding**: Documentation claims ability to remove signers
- **Reality**: Contract has no signer management
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Procedure impossible

### 3. CRITICAL BUG Response

#### ✓ VALIDATED: Emergency Timelock
```solidity
uint256 public constant EMERGENCY_TIMELOCK = 24 hours;
```
- Can use 24-hour emergency timelock
- Properly documented

#### ⚠ ISSUE: Missing Scripts
- `scripts/deploy-emergency-fix.js` not found
- `scripts/submit-upgrade.js` not found
- **Risk**: Cannot execute procedures

### 4. STAKING INSOLVENCY Response

#### ✓ VALIDATED: Reward Funding
```solidity
function depositRewards(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner
```
- Can fund reward pool as documented

#### ✓ VALIDATED: Pause Staking
```solidity
function pause() external onlyOwner { _pause(); }
```
- Can pause/unpause staking

#### ⚠ ISSUE: Missing Script
- `scripts/fund-rewards.js` not found

### 5. LIQUIDITY CRISIS Response

#### ✓ VALIDATED: Transfer Limits
```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_TRANSFER_AMOUNT = 100_000 ether;
uint256 public constant TRANSFER_COOLDOWN = 1 minutes;
```
- Has built-in transfer limits
- Rate limiting helps during crisis

#### ❌ ISSUE: Cannot Pause DEX
- Documentation claims ability to pause DEX interactions
- **Reality**: No DEX control in contracts
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Misleading procedure

## Script Availability Audit

### Required Scripts:
| Script | Purpose | Found | Status |
|--------|---------|-------|---------|
| emergency-pause.js | Pause all contracts | ❌ | MISSING |
| verify-deployment.js | Check status | ✓ | EXISTS |
| remove-signer.js | Remove compromised signer | ❌ | IMPOSSIBLE |
| deploy-emergency-fix.js | Deploy fixes | ❌ | MISSING |
| submit-upgrade.js | Submit upgrades | ❌ | MISSING |
| pause-staking.js | Pause staking | ❌ | MISSING |
| fund-rewards.js | Fund rewards | ❌ | MISSING |
| resume-staking.js | Resume staking | ❌ | MISSING |
| pause-dex.js | Pause DEX | ❌ | IMPOSSIBLE |

**Critical Finding**: 7 of 9 emergency scripts missing or impossible

## Emergency Capability Matrix

| Threat | Can Respond | Have Scripts | Tested | Ready |
|--------|-------------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Contract Compromise | ✓ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Key Compromise | Partial | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Critical Bug | ✓ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Staking Insolvency | ✓ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Liquidity Crisis | Partial | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Critical Gaps

### 1. ❌ IMPOSSIBLE PROCEDURES
- Cannot remove signers (contract doesn't support)
- Cannot pause DEX (no control mechanism)

### 2. ❌ MISSING IMPLEMENTATIONS
- 7 critical emergency scripts don't exist
- Procedures documented but not executable

### 3. ⚠ UNTESTED PROCEDURES
- No evidence of emergency drills
- No test results documented

## Risk Assessment

### Scenario: Attack Happens Now
1. Team reads emergency procedures ✓
2. Team tries to execute scripts ❌
3. Scripts don't exist ❌
4. Manual intervention required ⚠
5. Delays in response ❌
6. **Result**: FAILED RESPONSE

## Recommendations

### CRITICAL - Before Mainnet:
1. Create ALL missing emergency scripts
2. Remove impossible procedures from docs
3. Test all emergency procedures on testnet
4. Document actual capabilities accurately

### Required Scripts to Create:
```javascript
// emergency-pause.js
async function emergencyPause() {
    const token = await ethers.getContract("QXCTokenProduction");
    const staking = await ethers.getContract("QXCStakingFixed");
    
    // Pause token (via multi-sig)
    await submitMultiSigTx(token.address, token.interface.encodeFunctionData("pause"));
    
    // Pause staking (direct if owner is multi-sig)
    await staking.pause();
}
```

## Conclusion

**Emergency Procedures: NOT VALIDATED**

The documented procedures are **NOT EXECUTABLE** due to:
1. Missing implementation scripts (78% missing)
2. Impossible actions (signer removal, DEX pause)
3. No testing evidence

**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Status**: NOT READY FOR MAINNET

The system has theoretical emergency capabilities but lacks practical implementation. This creates a dangerous false sense of security.

**Required Action**: Must implement and test ALL emergency scripts before mainnet deployment.
