# Access Control Audit

## QXCTokenProduction.sol

### Roles Defined:
- `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: Full admin control
- `MINTER_ROLE`: Can mint new tokens
- `PAUSER_ROLE`: Can pause/unpause contract

### Access Control Analysis:

#### ✓ CORRECT: Role-Based Access
```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE)
function pause() external onlyRole(PAUSER_ROLE)
function unpause() external onlyRole(PAUSER_ROLE)
```
All privileged functions properly restricted to roles.

#### ✓ CORRECT: Multi-Sig Requirement
```solidity
modifier onlyMultiSig() {
    require(msg.sender == multiSigController, "Only multi-sig");
}
```
Critical functions like `enableTrading()` and `updateMultiSig()` require multi-sig.

#### ⚠ ISSUE: Role Transfer in updateMultiSig()
The `updateMultiSig()` function transfers ALL roles at once:
- Risk: If new controller is compromised, all roles are lost
- Mitigation: Already requires multi-sig approval (2-of-3)
- **FINDING**: Acceptable risk with multi-sig protection

#### ✓ CORRECT: Blacklist Control
Only `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` can modify blacklist - properly restricted.

## TimelockMultiSig.sol

### Access Control Analysis:

#### ✓ CORRECT: Signer Restrictions
```solidity
modifier onlySigner() {
    require(isSigner[msg.sender], "Not a signer");
}
```
All critical functions require signer status.

#### ✓ CORRECT: Signature Threshold
- Requires 2-of-3 signatures for execution
- Cannot be modified after deployment (hardcoded constants)

#### ⚠ ISSUE: No Signer Management
- **FINDING**: Cannot add/remove signers after deployment
- **Impact**: If a signer key is lost, cannot replace
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - operational risk
- **Status**: Acceptable for simplicity, documented risk

#### ✓ CORRECT: Emergency Stop
Only signers can trigger emergency stop, properly restricted.

## QXCStakingFixed.sol

### Access Control Analysis:

#### ✓ CORRECT: Owner Functions
```solidity
function depositRewards(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner
function pause() external onlyOwner
function unpause() external onlyOwner
```
Admin functions properly restricted to owner.

#### ✓ CORRECT: User Functions
- `stake()`: Open to all users (correct)
- `unstake()`: Only staker can unstake their own funds
- `emergencyWithdraw()`: Only affects caller's stake

#### ⚠ ISSUE: Single Owner Risk
- **FINDING**: Uses single owner, not multi-sig
- **Impact**: Single point of failure
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Recommendation**: Transfer ownership to multi-sig after deployment

## Summary

### Verified Correct:
1. ✓ Role-based access control properly implemented
2. ✓ Multi-sig required for critical token functions
3. ✓ User functions properly isolated
4. ✓ Emergency mechanisms restricted to authorized parties

### Issues Found:
1. **MEDIUM**: No signer management in multi-sig (accepted for simplicity)
2. **MEDIUM**: Staking uses single owner instead of multi-sig

### Recommendations:
1. Transfer staking contract ownership to multi-sig post-deployment
2. Document signer key backup procedures
3. Consider upgradeable multi-sig for future versions

## Conclusion
Access control is **MOSTLY CORRECT** with acceptable trade-offs for simplicity. Main risk is operational (key management) rather than technical vulnerability.
