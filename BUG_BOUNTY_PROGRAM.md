# üéØ QXC Bug Bounty Program

## Overview

The QXC DeFi Ecosystem Bug Bounty Program is designed to incentivize security researchers to find and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities in our smart contracts and systems. We believe that working with the security community is crucial for maintaining the highest security standards.
